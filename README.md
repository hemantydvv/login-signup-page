This project is a complete User Authentication and Role Management System built using PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap. It provides a secure workflow for user registration and login with features like password hashing (using PHP’s password_hash), server-side validation, and protected routes using PHP sessions.

The system supports two user roles: Admin and User, each gaining access to different dashboard content based on their permissions. Admin users receive elevated privilege visibility, while standard users are limited to basic access.

A robust session management system ensures that only authenticated users can access the dashboard, and all sensitive pages are protected. The database connection uses environment-based variables, improving security and making the application adaptable for both local and hosted deployments.

This project is fully deployed on a live hosting environment, showcasing seamless integration of backend logic, UI components, and real-world deployment practices. Perfect as a foundation for larger systems requiring authentication, authorization, and user management.
